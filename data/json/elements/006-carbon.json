  "summary": "Carbon is a chemical element with the symbol C and atomic number 6. It is nonmetallic and tetravalentâ€”making four electrons available to form covalent chemical bonds. It belongs to group 14 of the periodic table. Three isotopes occur naturally, 12C and 13C being stable, while 14C is a radionuclide, decaying with a half-life of about 5,730 years. Carbon is one of the few elements known since antiquity.",
